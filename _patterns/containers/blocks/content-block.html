title: Content Block
description: Content blocks can be linked to more information, in which case the whole card is a link. To make a card, apply the 'card' class to an &lt;a&gt; tag that wraps the card content. The 'equal-height' class can be used to force blocks (and other elements) of different heights to appear equal.
